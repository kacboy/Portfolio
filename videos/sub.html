                    This is a Minecraft creative build showcase video I built and filmed as the lead Multimedia Editor
                    at The Peak. The SUB is a building that has been under construction for the better part of 4 years
                    and is constantly getting delayed, so we thought we'd
                    take a crack at completing it. My assistant and I were already big Minecraft players but I learned
                    about <a href="https://www.replaymod.com/">Minecraft Replay Mod</a> and was able to utilize my
                    familiarity with
                    other in-game replay tools to create the time-lapse shots. It was our most viewed video of the
                    semester because of the zeitgeist around this building among students.
