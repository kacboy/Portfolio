                <p>This is a narrative short film I worked on as a course project with a small group of five over five weeks. I directed, edited, and co-wrote the film, I also filmed most of the interior scenes. It was very well received with 8 nominations
                    among the 30~ films that semester, and we won Best Film and Best Editing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This project really took off based on my idea that filming in an enclosed space with very little/no light would be challenging and fun. The film Buried (2010) was a core inspiration for knowing what was possible with this type of film.
                    If Hollywood could follow one character in a coffin for 90 minutes, we could do at least 5 minutes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Two years after it's initial release, I entered Truncate into the <a href="https://iatsuu.wixsite.com/filmfest">IATSU Film Fest</a>, where it won Best Cinematography out of the 26 films submitted.</p>
