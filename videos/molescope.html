                    This was the first public-facing marketing video of MetaOptima’s latest product, MoleScope Lite. The
                    product is a more budget and patient-friendly alternative to previous MoleScopes. It provides
                    patients with the ability to remotely and routinely submit their moles/spots for professional
                    review. This video was created to demonstrate the product’s purpose and workflow to doctors who may
                    want to implement MoleScope into their practice.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>This video came to fruition during the last few weeks of my Summer 2019 term as Assistant Multimedia
                    Editor for Simon Fraser University’s independent student newspaper, The Peak. I was inspired by the
                    music videos of YouTubers like
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/Svg_fIoHij8">Andrew Huang</a> and <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/xsF5CchOnhc">Joe Pena</a>. We wanted to make a video in a similar style,
                    but with an SFU focussed twist. At the time, SFU was undergoing major re-construction,
                    so it was kind of a humorous, yet cynical soundscape about the current state of our campus.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The lead Multimedia Editor had more experience creating music/beats using digital audio software so
                    she developed the audio/music/beat of the video. When the audio was done, I was given a few versions
                    of the file with various isolated
                    layers so I could hear each source independently, as well as this reference image:</p>

                <h3>Editing</h3>
                <p>We initially planned for different visual, as opposed to a video clip associated with each sound. But
                    alas, after the audio was created I had to go around campus and record video of each sound source.
                    Next, I basically had to recreate
                    the audio tracks with the video versions of each, which was very slow and gruelling as I had to sync
                    over 20 unique repeating clips.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’d synced up every video clip with their respective sounds, I had to go through again, cropping and
                    moving each clip into various arrangements based on what sounds were playing. At the same time I
                    wanted to build up the amount of clips
                    in frame at once to create a visual sense of progression. I think I was chipping away at editing
                    this video for nearly 2 weeks by the time I finished.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>With the way the lead Multimedia Editor and I had a audio handoff, I can’t image we could have
                    improved the process and time it took to create this video. Unless either of us was able to create
                    the beat/music using the video clips themselves,
                    but then the audio wouldn’t have turned out as well as it did. Creating a rhythmic soundscape and a
                    video are really quite different and this is the way it had to be created. In the end I think it was
                    worth it, it was one of our most
                    viewed videos for the entire year and we received a lot of positive feedback about it!</p>
