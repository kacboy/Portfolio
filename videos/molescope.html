                    This was the first public-facing marketing video of MetaOptima’s latest product, MoleScope Lite. The
                    product is a more budget and patient-friendly alternative to earlier MoleScope models. It provides
                    patients with the ability to remotely and routinely
                    submit their moles/spots for professional review. This video was created to demonstrate the
                    product’s purpose and workflow to doctors who may want to include MoleScope into their practice. I
                    was given a script and I created this video
                    over several weeks and multiple rounds of feedback.

                <h3>Filming</h3>
                <p>
                    While I didn’t create traditional storyboards, I did a few sketches early on as I was trying to
                    visualize the video content in my head. However, I knew I would be working around a very concise
                    script/voiceover so the key was to just make a recording of that, then start plugging in footage in
                    sync with the voiceover until eventually all the gaps are filled. It was obvious which sections
                    needed to be physical footage or screencaptures. But the remaining parts were unclear and had to be
                    filled with animations, transitions, or whatever I could come up with to keep things interesting,
                    while also dragging things out to keep the shotlist down. This video in particular was a balancing
                    act of transitions, voiceover pacing, and shot variety.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For the parts of the video where I needed to film the real physical product, I wanted a clean white
                    backdrop, similar to what’s been used in previous MetaOptima videos. I was unable to find a spot in
                    my house (working from home) with good lighting and a clean white surface so I improvised by using
                    blank printer paper as a backdrop, with a white LED ring light lamp I already owned (I knew it would
                    come in handy for videos one day!), which resulted in very consistent clean shots for the various
                    devices I needed to capture.

                <h3>Editing</h3>
                <p>
                    In the editing process, it was a lot of back and forth with various folks to get feedback on the
                    video. Some tasks were simple, like adding titles and progress bars for the various sections of the
                    video to make the workflow more clear. Other feedback sounded simple but turned out quite difficult
                    for technical reasons, such as adjusting the color of the physical MoleScope to match the digital
                    logo. Luckily there was no particular deadline for this video so I was able to polish out every
                    aspect of this video to great lengths.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The big thing that got the most feedback was the medical report towards the end, which auto
                    generates based on the options selected for the diagnosis. This went through several iterations and
                    required many layers of video ‘photoshopping’ to get the consistency of the patient, the report
                    text, and the interface just right. In general, I’m sure I could have gotten away with a lot more
                    rough edges and inconsistencies while editing but it’s much more satisfying when the only issues I
                    see in my work are general creative limitations and not technical mistakes.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of new animation and technical strategies while working on this video. For example,
                    the sequence where the iPhone is placed on the Melanoma mole is completely animated from a variety
                    of pre-existing photos, screen captures, and design resources because I wouldn’t have been able to
                    actually record a MoleScope Lite being used on serious skin condition (I believe I was the first
                    person outside of the hardware/executive team to receive a MoleScope Lite). In addition, I had to
                    find ways to tweak/optimize a lot of the other animations that were causing constant video rendering
                    bugs to occur.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Going back to the feedback on the medical report, that was the issue that led to the biggest lesson
                    I’ve learned from this project. I should always make sure to ask for more direction and guidance in
                    regards to the areas I’m unfamiliar with. In this case, anything about actual skin conditions and
                    professional practices that a doctor might notice in the video has to be as accurate as possible. I
                    can only go so far, guessing and making assumptions about what a medical report might look like, at
                    some point I need to seek help to create convincing demonstrations of the software. It would have
                    saved a lot of time to get input on that section of the video early on
