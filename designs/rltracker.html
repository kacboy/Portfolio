                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">RL Match Tracker is a fully developed Android app that provides
                        players with
                        game-to-game data tracking for the competitive multiplayer car-soccer videogame, Rocket
                        League.</span> Data is collected to showcase the players average abilities to highlight where
                    the player can improve. My project partner
                    and I thought that this was an untapped market for data tracking for Rocket League players, because
                    existing popular websites like <a href="https://rocketleague.tracker.network/">Tracker Network</a>
                    only showcase the players lifetime
                    career data, with no way to see specific match data.
                </p><br>

                    This application was developed over the course of the Fall 2019 semester for an android app
                    development course. My partner and I both programmed the application using Android Studio, but I
                    mostly focussed on the UX and visual development, while he focussed
                    on the back-end. The goal of the project was to create an Android application that uses an SQL
                    database. I did some additional polishing and published the app to <a
                        href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rlmatchtracker.interface2">Google
                        Play</a> on May 6th, 2020.

                <p>
                    The most advanced capability of the app is auto mode, which allows you to put your phone down during
                    gameplay. Then when you pick up your phone (ideally at the end of a match), the camera will activate
                    and you can take a picture of the final scoreboard.
                    This scoreboard will be saved for manual input when the user is free to do so. Referencing from your
                    scoreboard pictures, or with manual input, the app will save all inputted Rocket League match data
                    including the gamemode, score,
                    and your personal performance stats for each match. The app will present you with some graphs and
                    data such as your average score for each game.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The app also has some more fun features such as themes, which can be changed between blue or orange,
                    according to the team colours of Rocket League! There is also the ability to put in your Rocket
                    League account which will let the user easily view their
                    stats on <a href="https://rocketleague.tracker.network/">Tracker
                        Network</a>, for a broader view of their Rocket League career stats.

                <p>
                    For my project partner and I, it was our first time programming with Android Studio so there were
                    obviously many hurdles early on in the course. Beyond that, there was a lot of difficulties with the
                    SQL database, such as filter/sorting not working properly
                    because one of our data fields had dashes in it, this would cause conflicts when the sequential
                    search tried to go through the database. Another big challenge was that we wanted to save scoreboard
                    images in the same database as the
                    inputted match data, this led to challenges with compression and image-to-text conversion. We
                    figured these things out with a lot of Stack Overflow trial and error, and occasional help from our
                    our peers.
                </p><br><br>
                <h3 style="color: #0C88FC;">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    There were a few more features (dark mode, customizable charts, more sorting options) I wanted to
                    implement into the application to make it more useful, but each one would probably take me several
                    hours. I'm really proud of what we managed to pull of
                    with this app, and despite the challenges we faced along the way, we received 100% on the final
                    presentation. Having a project with a core theme that you are actually interested in is a great
                    motivator to create something great. I
                    spent many late nights fixing some very minor bugs that were driving me nuts just because I wanted
                    the application to be capable of what we pitched and it was something I could see myself using.
                    Lastly, a huge thing I wish we put more
                    effort into was figuring how to use Git so collaborating on our codebase would have been easier. We
                    were fortunate in that we didn't have any major issues just zipping up our cide to each other.
