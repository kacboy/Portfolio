        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">RL Match Tracker provides players with game-to-game data tracking for the
            competetive multiplayer car-soccer
            videogame, Rocket League.</span> Data is collected to showcase the players average abilities to highlight
          where the
          player can improve. My project partner and I thought that this was an untapped market for data tracking for
          Rocket League players, because existing popular websites like <a
            href="https://rocketleague.tracker.network/">Tracker Network</a> only showcase
          the players lifetime career data, with no way to see specific match data.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          This project was developed over the course of the Fall 2019 semester for an android app development course. My
          partner and I both programmed the application using Android Studio, but I moslty focussed on the UX and visual
          development, while he focussed on the back-end. The goal of the project was to create an Android application
          that uses an SQL database. I did some additional polishing and published the app to <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rlmatchtracker.interface2">Google Play</a> on May
          6th, 2020.

        <h3 style="color: #0C88FC;">Features</h3>
        <p>
          The most advanced capability of the app is auto mode, which allows you to put your phone down during
          gameplay.
          Then when you pick up your phone (ideally at the end of a amtch), the camera
          will activate and you can take a picture of the final scoreboard. This scoreboard will be saved for manual
          input when the user is free to do so. Refrencing from your socreboard pictures, or with manual input, the
          app
          will save all inputted Rocket League match data including the gamemode, score, and your personal
          performance
          stats for each match. The app will present you with some graphs and data such as your average score for
          each
          game.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          The app also has some more fun features such as themes, which can be changed between blue or orange,
          according
          to the team colours of Rocket League! There is also the ability to put in your Rocket League account which
          will let the user easily view their stats on <a href="https://rocketleague.tracker.network/">Tracker
            Network</a>, for a broader view of their Rocket League career stats.

        <p>
          The biggest challenge was finding a way to compress and store an indefinite amount of images in the SQL
          database alongside all the other match data.
          By using BitmapFactory and Base64 functions we were able to convert images into strings that save in the
          database. These strings could be decoded and displayed again as regular images when we needed to view them in
          an activity.
