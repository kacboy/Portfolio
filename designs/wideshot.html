                <p>
                    This is a senior publishing course project where each student had to create an original magazine
                    brand and design. I took this course remotely in Summer 2020 so we didn't actually have to print any
                    pages. I took this as a chance to be more creative with
                    my layouts and made a more unconventionally sized magazine, since I didn't need to worry about
                    printing a unique size of page.
                </p><br><br>
                <h3 style="color: #1b809a;">Editorial Mandate</h3>
                <p>
                    Wideshot would cover independent, hobbyist, and student film related topics. The tone should be
                    casual, educational, and inspiring. The magazine would be split into three sections with different
                    content focuses:
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-production</span><br> This section would cover topics like
                    screenwriting, creative techniques, equipment, and other valuable knowledge pieces that would help a
                    reader before the cameras are rolling.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Principle photography</span><br> This section would be the draw of
                    the magazine around the gutter, containing interviews, previews, and long form features.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Post-production</span><br> This section would contain reviews of
                    notable indie films, post-mortems, highlights of student films, opinion pieces, and other other
                    reader driven content such as film competitions.

                <p>
                    The name Wideshot is a term unique to filmmaking, photography, and cinematography that is both
                    specific and creative in itself. A wideshot could capture an entire scene, a location, or a
                    character. This term is a clear-cut way of portraying the magazine’s
                    broad coverage of the filmic mediums.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The size of the cover and magazine is based on the industry standard CinemaScope film aspect ratio
                    of 2.39:1. A full spread of the magazine is 20”x8.5” (10”x8.5” pages) to stay within common
                    printable sizes. The typeface and logo was chosen because of
                    it’s modern sans-serif style and the thick, wide characters would allow for an effective knock-out
                    effect with the cover image. The space for the cover image between the two white ‘letterboxes’ is
                    16:9, another industry standard aspect
                    ratio. The cover image was chosen because of it’s bold color and strong sense of emotion. The cover
                    lines were made very minimal and uniform because I didn’t ever want to intrude over the images on
                    the cover or in the magazine to preserve
                    there intended visual qualities.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    For the feature spread I wanted the images to be the forefront of each page and to not ever be
                    covered by text or distracting graphics. I used the images and line elements as the anchors of each
                    spread, and tried not to overflow any page with too much
                    text.
