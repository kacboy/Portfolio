        <p>
          This is a senior publishing course project where each student had to create an original magazine brand and
          design. I took this course remotely in Summer 2020 so we didn't actually have to print any pages. I took this
          as a
          chance to be more creative with my layouts and made a more unconventionally sized magazine, since I didn't
          need to worry about printing a unique size of page.
        </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="color: #1b809a;">Editorial Mandate</h3>
        <p>
          Wideshot would cover independent, hobbyist, and student film related topics. The tone should be casual,
          educational, and inspiring. The magazine would be split into three sections with different content focuses:
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-production</span><br>
          This section would cover topics like screenwriting, creative techniques, equipment, and other valuable
          knowledge pieces that would help a reader before the cameras are rolling.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Principle photography</span><br>
          This section would be the draw of the magazine around the gutter, containing interviews, previews, and long
          form features.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Post-production</span><br>
          This section would contain reviews of notable indie films, post-mortems, highlights of student films, opinion
          pieces, and other other reader driven content such as film competitions.

        <p>
          The name Wideshot is a term unique to filmmaking, photography, and cinematography that is both specific and
          creative in itself. A wideshot could capture an entire scene, a location, or a character. This term is a
          clear-cut way of portraying the magazine’s broad coverage of the filmic mediums.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          The size of the cover and magazine is based on the industry standard CinemaScope film aspect ratio of 2.39:1.
          A full spread of the magazine is 20”x8.5” (10”x8.5” pages) to stay within common printable sizes. The typeface
          and logo was chosen because of it’s modern sans-serif style and the thick, wide characters would allow for an
          effective knock-out effect with the cover image. The space for the cover image between the two white
          ‘letterboxes’ is 16:9, another industry standard aspect ratio. The cover image was chosen because of it’s bold
          color and strong sense of emotion. The cover lines were made very minimal and uniform because I didn’t ever
          want to intrude over the images on the cover or in the magazine to preserve there intended visual qualities.
        </p><br>
        For the feature spread I wanted the images to be the forefront of each page
        and to not ever be covered by text or distracting
        graphics. I used the images and line elements as the
        anchors of each spread, and tried not to overflow
        any page with too much text.
